# Fine-Tune3.5-Turbo
###This project is sample airbnb chatbot that responds to customer's queries from the trained model.
###This chatbot is trained on chatgpt-3.5 turbo on a sample size of 85 rows.
###To train your model using own data, Openai requires specific format that corresponds to system, user and ### assistant responses.For this reason, we need to prepare our data.


# What are we going to do?
1- generate data using gpt4 or your own data.
2- convert it to csv-utf-8 format.
3- install and import the required libraries.
4- configure your openai api key.
5- load your csv data.
6- using openai data formating script, clean and format your data and store it back as jsonl.
7- using openai scripts with modification, we can count the number of tokens, flag warning if number of tokens exceed 4096 tokens. at the end, we can count the estimated cost per 100k tokens at current price rate.
8- after verifying that data is ready for training, we create a function to upload the data as "cleaned-jsonl" data.
9- upload your data to openai.the function i to code can print the file ID generated by openai for our file.
10- create fine tuning job and run the training job. (in the retrieve fine-tune model id, we can get the ID of the fine tuned model.)
11- Test the model using system and user prompt.
12- we can use gradio interface for testing at the end.
